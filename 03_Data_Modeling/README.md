## 03_Data_Modeling – Architectural Design & Data Structuring
Purpose: Creating and documenting efficient data models by translating complex domain descriptions into technical blueprints.
- Modeling Process & Documentation:
    - Managed the end-to-end modeling workflow, from conceptual and logical to physical data models.
    - Documented the modeling process through ER Diagrams, UML Diagrams, and the use of Data Dictionaries.
    - Formulated clear relationship statements and defined cardinality to ensure data integrity.

- Optimization & Theory:
    - Applied Normalization and Denormalization theories to structure databases according to specific business and technical requirements.
    - Analyzed the strengths and weaknesses of the relational model in comparison to NoSQL models.

- Tools & Implementation:
    - Utilized industry-standard modeling tools (e.g., Lucidchart) to design and visualize architectural solutions.
    - Transformed abstract business requirements into optimized, purposeful data structures.
