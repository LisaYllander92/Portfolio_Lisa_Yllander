## 01_Programming – Python Development & Engineering Fundamentals
Purpose: Mastering foundational programming with a focus on Python, version control, and data engineering workflows.

- Core Programming & OOP:
    - Developed structured and modular programs using Python's core building blocks: sequences, iterations, selections, and functions.
    - Implemented Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, including classes and objects.

- Data Handling & Integration:
    - Built proficiency in ingesting, cleaning, and "washing" data from diverse sources and formats (CSV, Excel, JSON, XML, and APIs).
    - Utilized modules and packages to extend functionality and manage complex data tasks.
- Environment & Version Control:
    - Managed development environments using virtual environments (e.g., uv).
    - Demonstrated an efficient workflow in Git via terminal, including clear documentation and structured commits on GitHub.
- Testing & Quality:
    - Applied validation and testing techniques to ensure code meets specific requirements and high coding standards.
