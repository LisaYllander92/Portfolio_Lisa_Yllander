## 02_SQL – Relational Databases & Advanced Querying
Purpose: Developing specialized skills in SQL and relational database management, focusing on everything from data ingestion to security and performance tuning.

- Database Design & Architecture:
     - Applied knowledge of relational database concepts (tables, schemas, rows, and columns).
    - Created and analyzed databases based on technical specifications and ER diagrams.

- Querying & Insights:
    - Performed complex data extraction using SQL, including multi-table Joins, CTEs (Common Table Expressions), and grouping.
    - Integrated SQL databases with Python to automate data workflows and analysis.

- Performance & Security:
    - Conducted database tuning to identify bottlenecks and implemented optimizations such as indexing and denormalization.
    - Explored database security protocols, including access management and protection against threats like SQL injections.
