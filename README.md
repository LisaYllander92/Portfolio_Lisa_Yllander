# 🚀 Data Engineering Portfolio 
Welcome to my portfolio repository! This space serves as a comprehensive collection of my projects and laboratory work completed during my Data Engineering program at STI (Stockholm Institute of Technology).


## 📂 Project Overview & Structure
I have organized my work into dedicated folders following the curriculum's progression. Each section highlights specific technical competencies and problem-solving approaches.

### 01_Programming – Python Development & Engineering Fundamentals
Purpose: Mastering foundational programming with a focus on Python, version control, and data engineering workflows.

- Core Programming & OOP:
    - Developed structured and modular programs using Python's core building blocks: sequences, iterations, selections, and functions.
    - Implemented Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, including classes and objects.

- Data Handling & Integration:
    - Built proficiency in ingesting, cleaning, and "washing" data from diverse sources and formats (CSV, Excel, JSON, XML, and APIs).
    - Utilized modules and packages to extend functionality and manage complex data tasks.
- Environment & Version Control:
    - Managed development environments using virtual environments (e.g., uv).
    - Demonstrated an efficient workflow in Git via terminal, including clear documentation and structured commits on GitHub.
- Testing & Quality:
    - Applied validation and testing techniques to ensure code meets specific requirements and high coding standards.

### 02_SQL – Relational Databases & Advanced Querying
Purpose: Developing specialized skills in SQL and relational database management, focusing on everything from data ingestion to security and performance tuning.

- Database Design & Architecture:
     - Applied knowledge of relational database concepts (tables, schemas, rows, and columns).
    - Created and analyzed databases based on technical specifications and ER diagrams.

- Querying & Insights:
    - Performed complex data extraction using SQL, including multi-table Joins, CTEs (Common Table Expressions), and grouping.
    - Integrated SQL databases with Python to automate data workflows and analysis.

- Performance & Security:
    - Conducted database tuning to identify bottlenecks and implemented optimizations such as indexing and denormalization.
    - Explored database security protocols, including access management and protection against threats like SQL injections.

### 03_Data_Modeling – Architectural Design & Data Structuring
Purpose: Creating and documenting efficient data models by translating complex domain descriptions into technical blueprints.
- Modeling Process & Documentation:
    - Managed the end-to-end modeling workflow, from conceptual and logical to physical data models.
    - Documented the modeling process through ER Diagrams, UML Diagrams, and the use of Data Dictionaries.
    - Formulated clear relationship statements and defined cardinality to ensure data integrity.

- Optimization & Theory:
    - Applied Normalization and Denormalization theories to structure databases according to specific business and technical requirements.
    - Analyzed the strengths and weaknesses of the relational model in comparison to NoSQL models.

- Tools & Implementation:
    - Utilized industry-standard modeling tools (e.g., Lucidchart) to design and visualize architectural solutions.
    - Transformed abstract business requirements into optimized, purposeful data structures.
