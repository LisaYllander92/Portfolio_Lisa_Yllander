# 🚀 Data Engineering Portfolio 
Welcome to my portfolio repository! This space serves as a comprehensive collection of my projects and laboratory work completed during my Data Engineering program at STI (Stockholm Institute of Technology).


## 📂 Project Overview & Structure
I have organized my work into dedicated folders following the curriculum's progression. Each section highlights specific technical competencies and problem-solving approaches.

To keep this portfolio organized and concise, each course folder contains its own dedicated README file. These sub-level readmes provide in-depth details about specific learning objectives, project tasks, and links to the original course repositories for full commit history.
